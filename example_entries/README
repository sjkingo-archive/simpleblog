In here lie some sample entries to show the syntax required for both
blog entries and linkrolls. In general, an entry is a collection of
(key: value) pairs that make up the metadata, with an optional body 
text at the end, parsed using markdown.

There are two types of entries (specified by entry-type):
 * blog
 * linkroll

Metadata must be specified one-per-line, with no blank lines or other
data mixed in. A blank line signifies end of metadata and the start of
the body. Comments are forbidden.
