simpleblog
==========

simpleblog is a blogging platform that is intented to be have a low barrier to
setup and entry, and to make publishing blog entries simple and trivial to do.

It takes input as a series of MIME-type text files describing the entry and its
content (see example-entries) and outputs as a HTML tree ready to be published.

A lot of the ideas for simpleblog are taken from a fellow blogging platform called
constance (http://github.com/danc86/constance). The primary purpose of this system
is to provide extensibility via filters and converters. Filters can be defined 
as submodules to alter the text as it is processed (such as converting from 
markdown to HTML). New entry types can be easily added as a converter and 
built on the fly.

To get started, make sure all of the DEPENDS are satisfied and run:

::

    main.py directory_full_of_entries/
