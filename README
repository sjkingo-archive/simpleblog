simpleblog
==========

simpleblog is a blogging platform that is intented to be have a low barrier to
setup and entry, and to make publishing blog entries simple and trivial to do.

It takes input as a series of MIME-type text files describing the entry and its
content (see example-entries) and applies an XSLT stylesheet to render an 
output of HTML, ready to be published.

A lot of the ideas for simpleblog are taken from a fellow blogging platform
called constance (http://github.com/danc86/constance). The primary purpose of
this system is to provide extensibility via filters. Filters can be defined as
submodules to alter the text as it is processed (such as converting from
markdown to HTML).

To get started, make sure all of the DEPENDS are satisfied and run:

::

    publish.py -f entry.txt

You can also run the publisher over more than one entry by specifying a directory:

::

    publish.py -d directory_full_of_entries/

The published HTML file will be placed in the same directory as the input entry.
